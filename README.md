## Note
> - The code structure in this repository is intentionally designed to reflect **clean coding practices and standard architectural principles**.
> - While the actual requirement could have been implemented with a much simpler approach, this project goes beyond that.
> - It aims to serve as a benchmark for `maintainable`, `scalable`, and `well-structured` code.
> - The focus is on demonstrating an **ideal way of organizing logic**, not just solving the problem minimally.
